# flask_todo

Created by following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKHJsLUENl0
To refresh on how Flask works as a framework alongside basic SQLAlchemy commands.

Styling will be done entirely without this video however.

File structure is largely simplified (won't use this way on larger projects) with a singular app.py that holds all the business logic.

Project developing as follows:

    1. Create Skeleton with Imports.
    2. Add basic data passthrough between app.py and base.html
    3. Create SQLite DB and use data passthrough.
    4. Add CRUD functionality.
    5. Style Components.
